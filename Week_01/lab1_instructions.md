2. Create a geojson named `lab1.geojson` and add it to your repository.

3. Create a new markdown file called `lab1.md` and explain the following:
   -  What fields you used
   -  Why you used these fields
   -  What problems could the data set have
4. Commit both `lab1.geojson` and `lab1.md` to your repository and push it to GitHub.
