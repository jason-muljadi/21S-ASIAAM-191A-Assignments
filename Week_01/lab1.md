   ## 1. What fields you used
    For my new field generated, named 'NAM-AREASQ,' I analyzed the population of Native Americans over the area sq. per km by using the formula: "NATIVE_AM" / "AREA_SQ_KM". I mapped this value out on QGIS and had a gradient formed. As a fun comparison, I also used the white population but I did not integrate that into my map, because I felt that having two gradients would be confusing.

   ## 2. Why you used these fields

    I wanted to see the aggregate amount of Native Americans in the California counties per sq. km. I felt that this is the appropriate way to measure population density, rather than by using the function 'POP_DENSIT.' "NATIVE_AM" and "AREA_SQ_KM" represented the total population in a numerical value of Native Americans and the dimensions of the Californian county's landmass as a square kilometers respectively. 
    
    On a more personal level, I recently took a course on Native American history and I wanted to see the ramifications of the California Genocide and what that did to the indigenous population of America. Indigenous folks' territories have been wiped out and erased, making it absolutely difficult to find out the original territory of Native Americans. Western cartography, especially that of California's, is mired in white settler colonialism and violence, and the vast population of white folks that occupy this land that was once filled with an abundance of indigenous folks shows the long lasting ramifications of the California genocide and how the United States killed off Native Americans. 

    In community, there is solidarity. To see communities of Native Americans still living and thriving is encouraging, but we also want to take into consideration what lands that they occupy and what forms of reparations this society must make in order to ensure that the population of American Indians are safe and have equitable opportunities to thrive in this society.

   ## 3. What problems could the data set have
    Every data set is problematic in its own sense because of a myriad of reasons, including faulty data, miscommunication, misunderstanding, and geographical hardships. For example, it may be difficult to gather data from communities living far away from each other, unlike in Los Angeles County, where there is a greater population density of individuals. In addition, data collection is dependent on people filling out the datasheet with as much accuracy as they can obtain. 
    
    Some individuals might not even want to fill out the data sheet. In addition, some folks may put incorrect data, whether it's out of an accidental misunderstanding or if intentional. A perfect data set is when all individuals of a community perfectly and honestly answers each question accordingly, which is difficult.
