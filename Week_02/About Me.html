    <p><h1>What Do I Do</h1></p>
    <p>Jason is a 4th year Neuroscience major and History minor at UCLA. Born in Jakarta, he immigrated to the United States when he was two years old, and it was there where he fostered his love of the sciences and of history. In high school, he had the opportunity to delve into the realm of neurodegenerative diseases and to teach eighth graders at a school in Lake Balboa. Jason chose to pursue Neuroscience because of his interest in neurodegenerative disease research, specifically in Alzheimer’s Disease. In his research lab, he enjoys working with Drosophila and learning the techniques needed to conduct mitochondrial research. In addition, he currently works at Thermo Fisher Scientific as an Operator for the LABType Pre-Production team. Outside of the lab and workplace, Jason is the co-Founder and the 2020-2021 Presidnt of UCLA’s Association of Indonesian Americans. He was also the former Cultural Awareness and Community Service co-Chair of UCLA Nikkei Student Union as well as a performing member of the drama cast for their Culture Night. Jason works extensively to raise awareness in the Asian American/Indonesian American community, providing educational services especially in STEM. His hobbies include napping, singing, traveling, and occasionally going to the gym. Jason plans on pursuing a PhD in Neuroscience, where he hopes to fill in the knowledge gap in Alzheimer’s Disease research.</p>
